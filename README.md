# BeckyPay
BeckyPay QR Payment App is a simple iOS application built using SwiftUI and CodeScanner. It allows users to scan QR codes and perform payment transactions seamlessly.
## The app provides two main features:
* QR Code Scanning: Users can use the app to scan QR codes, primarily designed for payment purposes.
  When a QR code is successfully scanned, the app displays the scanned code along with the user's wallet balance.
  This feature is powered by the CodeScanner library, enabling efficient QR code recognition.
* QR Code Generation: The app also offers a QR code generation feature, allowing users to generate QR codes based on the text they input.
  This can be utilized for generating payment requests or sharing information with other users.
## Key Features:
* Scan QR codes for payment transactions.
* Display scanned QR code along with the user's wallet balance.
* Generate QR codes based on user-input text.
* Seamless navigation using SwiftUI's navigation views.
* CodeScanner integration for efficient QR code recognition.
## Usage:
* Launch the app and explore the home screen.
* Use the "Scan QR Code" button to activate the QR code scanner.
* Hold the scanner over a QR code to initiate the scanning process.
* After successful scanning, the app displays the scanned QR code and wallet balance.
* Alternatively, use the "QR Code Generator" section to create QR codes based on user-provided text.
## Technologies Used:
* SwiftUI: For creating the user interface and navigation.
* CodeScanner: A Swift package for integrating QR code scanning capabilities.
* CoreImage: For generating QR code images.
* NavigationLink: For seamless navigation between views.
